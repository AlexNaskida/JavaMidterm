### 1. Describe what challenges you faced during this exam and how you resolved them. (1 point)

During the exam I challenged a lot of issues. One of them was with creating the PMS system, while  brainstorming code that changed the employee name and salary. 
To solve this I referred to ChatGPT where AI helped me understand how to work with classes, methods, and object manipulation.

### 2. Tell whether AI tools were useful in helping you learn Java constructs that were new to you in this exam. Describe the tasks in which AI was useful. Tell which part of the job was done using AI (2 point).

The primarily use of AI was to guide me into renaming variables, adding new methods like modifyEmployeeSalary, and ensuring correct logic for matching and updating data.
The AI helped mainly with writing and explaining the code structure and maintaining a clear code.

### 3. Describe the cases where you have tried AI, but without desired result. (1 point).

 I can't recall such a moment. Everything was smooth and clean.
